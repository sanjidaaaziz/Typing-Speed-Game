# Typing-Speed-Game
The Python Speed Typing Test is a simple yet effective technique to measure typing speed. The program can be executed on any system that has Python installed. The user must type as rapidly and accurately as they can once the program generates random words . While the user types, the program logs their input and gives them feedback on their accuracy and speed at the end of the program execution.
A number of Python libraries are used by the Speed Typing Test Project, including Tkinter and random for generating random words and phrases and the graphical user interface, respectively. The program is designed to be user-friendly and easy to navigate.
